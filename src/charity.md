## For the 2015 award ceremony we will be supporting Fisher&nbsp;House as out chosen&nbsp;charity.

Fisher House is a &ldquo;home away from home&rdquo; for&nbsp;military patients and their families, located within walking distance of the hospital. It&nbsp;was&nbsp;officially opened on the 21,&nbsp;June&nbsp;2013 by&nbsp;HRH The Prince&nbsp;of&nbsp;Wales.

At Fisher House families can stay in&nbsp;a&nbsp;supportive environment, just a short walk from where their loved ones are undergoing treatment at&nbsp;the&nbsp;hospital.

Each of the 18 spacious en-suite family sized bedrooms offers a&nbsp;safe haven at a&nbsp;time when families need it most. Families take great comfort and strength in sharing their experiences with others in&nbsp;the same situation and this is why communal living is at the heart of the&nbsp;house.

With a family room, play area, homely lounges, a dining area and laundry room, not&nbsp;to&nbsp;mention the fantastic large and spacious kitchen – every facility that a&nbsp;family could need has been catered&nbsp;for.

Fisher&nbsp;House offers support for all: injured military personnel, many of whom served in&nbsp;Iraq and Afghanistan and continue to&nbsp;return&nbsp;to&nbsp;the&nbsp;hospital for more surgery, and&nbsp;personnel who&nbsp;are&nbsp;receiving treatment for&nbsp;illness –&nbsp;from cancer care&nbsp;to&nbsp;transplants.

Fisher&nbsp;House gives on average over 4000&nbsp;nights of&nbsp;accommodation to&nbsp;families annually&nbsp;and will continue to&nbsp;do&nbsp;so&nbsp;for many years, with&nbsp;your&nbsp;help.
