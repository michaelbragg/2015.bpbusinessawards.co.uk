This category recognises a company who has excelled in their field of expertise, developed staff and made a considerate positive impact on the local business community.

## Eligibility

This award aims to find the overall outstanding company from all of the category winners plus companies that do not fall into any other category.

Nominations cannot be made for this category. The judges will choose a winner from category winners and consider other companies that they feel do not fall into another category.

## Judging Criteria

The judges will pay particular attention to:

- Sustained financial growth
- Job creation
- Demonstrable benefit to the regional economy
- Commitment to the region

## General

All financial information will be treated in the strictest of confidence and will not be disclosed to anyone other than the panel of judges and advisers. Please provide enough relevant information to enable the assessors to form a clear picture of your achievements.

If successful in being shortlisted for the award, a summary of your company will appear in the Birmingham Post&rsquo;s coverage, along with the information you provide on this form (except specific financials). Please include any general background information which you would be happy to see in print.
