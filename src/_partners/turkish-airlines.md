Turkish Airlines is a leading global commercial airline, flying to more countries than any other airline in the world.

At the 2015 Skytrax awards Turkish Airlines have been awarded &ldquo;Best Airline in Europe&rdquo;, for a fifth consecutive year. &ldquo;Best Airline in Southern Europe&rdquo;, &ldquo;World&rsquo;s Best Business Class Airline Lounge&rdquo;, and &ldquo;World&rsquo;s Best Business Class Lounge Dining&rdquo;.

Turkish Airlines is one of Europe&rsquo;s fastest growing airlines and as of summer 2015 we are proud to announce that we have 115 weekly flights from the UK alone. We fly to 276 cities in 110 countries and our fleet of 289 aircrafts is one of the youngest in Europe.

Turkish Airlines first started flying from Birmingham Airport in December, 2008 and we now operate 12 flights a week. We use Boeing 737-800 aircrafts with dedicated Business Class cabins to make our customers&rsquo; flights more comfortable. Our expansion in the Midlands in recent years shows our commitment to the region.

Turkish Airlines continues to focus on delivering a high quality service, widening the world of our passengers and reaffirming our position as one of the world&rsquo;s leading airlines.
