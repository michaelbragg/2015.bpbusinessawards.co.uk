The UK is, and will remain, the cornerstone of Jaguar Land Rover&rsquo;s business. The heart of our company sits here with the core of our design, engineering and manufacturing capabilities based in the UK.

Over the last five years, we have doubled production in the UK, investing heavily so that our UK facilities can grow towards full capacity. We have invested more than &pounds;11 billion in new product
creation and capital expenditure across our business.

We have employed more than 20,000 people taking our workforce to more than 36,000 currently. We have recruited some 2,000 young people on graduate and apprentice programmes with 7,000 employees in further education.

In addition, we are expanding our research and development footprint at Whitley and Gaydon. We are a partner in the &pound;150m National Automotive Innovation Centre at Warwick University.

We have significant global growth ambitions that will secure the future of our company for generations to come. The next step in our strategy is to become an increasingly efficient, competitive and profitable global business.

The creation of international plants allows us to deliver more new products to our growing customer base. This increases our competitiveness, maximising efficient access to the supply chain and logistics infrastructure, and protecting ourselves against currency fluctuations.

Jaguar Land Rover is the only UK automotive company to achieve a Platinum Big Tick in the Business in the Community (BITC) Corporate Responsibility Index and was awarded BITC &lsquo;Responsible Business of the Year 2013&rsquo; for investments in UK jobs and facilities, improving the environmental performance of its vehicles and manufacturing operations and increasing skills and education opportunities for employees and young people.
