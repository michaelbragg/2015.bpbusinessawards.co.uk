Power Minerals is a Sutton Coldfield based business which provides services to the UK power generation industry. From its foundation in 2003 it has grown to become the biggest coal ash marketing company in the UK with its core business being the sale of by-products from coal-fired power stations as valuable and sustainable construction materials used in cement and concrete applications.

With the increasing use of biomass as a fuel for power generation Power Minerals has developed a pioneering solution for use of biomass ashes as constituents of fertiliser products.

Power Minerals is proud of its roots in Birmingham providing both direct and indirect employment opportunities in the area.
