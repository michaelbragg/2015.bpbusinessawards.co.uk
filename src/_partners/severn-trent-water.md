Severn Trent Water is the UK&rsquo;s second biggest water company. We&nbsp;serve 4.2m homes and businesses in England and Wales, with our region stretching from mid-Wales to Rutland, and from the Bristol Channel to the Humber. We&nbsp;deliver almost two billion litres of water every day through 46,000km of&nbsp;pipes. We&nbsp;own and operate a&nbsp;further 91,000km of&nbsp;sewer pipes, which take waste water away to&nbsp;more than 1,000&nbsp;sewage treatment works in&nbsp;the&nbsp;region.
