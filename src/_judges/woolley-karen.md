Few people in the West Midlands work closely with more small companies than Karen Woolley.

As development manager at Federation of Small Businesses (FSB) in Staffordshire and West Midlands, Ms Woolley works with growing firms on a day-by-day basis.

The FSB is the UK&rsquo;s largest campaigning pressure group promoting and protecting the interests of the self-employed and owners of small firms.
